# RSA

The RSA encryption and decryption project is a console-based application written in C++ that implements the RSA algorithm to secure the communication between two parties, with features such as key generation, message encryption, and decryption. 


## Prerequisites

Require Visual Studio for compiling and running.
## Roadmap
- The `powMod` function is too slow, need to optimize.
- Find a more efficient way to encrypt files instead of encrypting each character in the file.
